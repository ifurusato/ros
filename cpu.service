# This cpu service configuration file should be copied to:
#
#  /lib/systemd/system/
#
# After copying the file you'll need to reload all daemons:
#
#  % sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#
# and to enable its use upon each startup:
#
#  % sudo systemctl enable cpu
#
# You can then use it like service, e.g.,
#
#  % sudo systemctl status cpu
#  % sudo systemctl start cpu
#  % sudo systemctl stop cpu
#
# This requires use of the python-daemon library, which can be installed via:
#
#  % sudo pip3 install python-daemon
#
